# Spouse Visa and Residence Card Part 2: The Japanese Visa

![Visa header](visa_header.jpg "The coveted VISA")

In the last post ([Spouse Visa and Residence Card Part 1: The COE](https://konbinikeyboard.com/posts/coe-and-me/)), I discussed the steps I took to apply and receive the Certficate of Eligibility (COE). With the COE in hand, now comes part two: applying for the Visa. 

This part was probably the *easiest* in terms of getting this completed. I was pretty blown away on how simple and straightforward this process was. 

I followed the process and guidelines laid out on the [Embassy of Japan in the United States of America: Visa COE Holders](https://www.us.emb-japan.go.jp/itpr_en/visa-coe.html) site. 

## Gathering the Required Documents 

The link for the [Visa COE Holders](https://www.us.emb-japan.go.jp/itpr_en/visa-coe.html) has all the required documents you will need to gather prior to submitting your package + passport to the embassy. Here is the list below (just in case):

- **Visa Application Form** - can be found [here](https://www.mofa.go.jp/files/000124525.pdf)

  *Note*: This form requires a wet signature; digital signatures are invalid

- **Valid/Non-Expired Passport**

- **2" x 2" Photo**

  *Note*: This must be a passport style photo - plain background, no filters. You can go to any photo kiosk that does passport photos or go to an actual photo studio. I went to one near my house [here](https://selfotostudios.com/price-list). You can also go to most CVS or Walgreens and they should be able to do passport style photos as well. 

- **Proof of Residency** - this can be your valid driver's license or a utility bill with your name and address. To keep it simple, I just used my valid driver's license. You'll also need to bring in a photocopy of this. 
- **Certificate of Eligibility** - your actual, hard copy of the COE + 1 copy. 
- **Money (just in case)** - Depending, you may have to pay for your Visa. I am not sure why but I did not have to pay anything for my spouse visa. However, check the prices on the [Visa COE Holders](https://www.us.emb-japan.go.jp/itpr_en/visa-coe.html) site and be prepared. 

## Filling Out the Application 

There is a [sample](https://www.us.emb-japan.go.jp/files/100908712.pdf) form that is provided that walks you through on how to fill this out. Again, it was pretty simple and straightforward. 

I filled out the application on my computer, printed it out, and signed it. I'm a fairly cautious person so I also printed out a blank copy of the application form just in case I made a mistake and needed to fill it out at the embassy. I didn't need to do this, but it didn't hurt to be prepared. 

## Application + Required Documents Drop-off at the Japanese Embassy

I am lucky to live not to far from the Japanese Embassy in Washington DC. To drop off your application and package, there is **no appointment required**. You can walk in, go to the counter, and drop it off. Here are a couple of things to be mindful of:

- Parking: There is no parking at the Embassy, meaning you'll have to find street parking. I usually park in one of side streets across from the Embassy. No issues there. 
- Drop-off hours: Monday-Friday, 0915-1200. Anything after 1200 will not be accepted 
- Ensure you are not going on a [holiday designated by the Embassy of Japan](https://www.us.emb-japan.go.jp/itpr_en/embassy.html)
- If weather is bad and OPM announces federal agencies are closed, then the Embassy of Japan will follow suit and will also be closed. 

Once you have everything lined up and you head to the Embassy, you will see signs on which counter to go to. You wait in line and go to the counter once its your turn. If everything is filled out, you have your copies of the required documents, it should be an in-and-out process. The processing time from submission to receiving your passport with the visa is **about 5 business days**. 

The embassy staff will give you a pink piece of paper. **DO NOT LOSE THIS PAPER** as this is the receipt you will need to provide once your passport is ready for pickup.

## Picking Up Your Visa and Passport

That pink receipt you will receive will have the information you will need to pick up your visa and passport. After you have waited the allotted time, head back to the embassy in DC, find parking, and pick up your goods. 

Remember to check the Embassy site for the pick up times, as this will differ from the drop off times. This information should also be on the pink receipt. For your notes: **pick-up times are Monday - Friday, 1330-1600**.

## Next Steps

Now that you have your passport with Visa in hand, you need to plan your trip to Japan. One of the requirements on receiving the COE is that **you must enter Japan within 3 months of the date of issue of your COE**. Ensure that you have your ticket to Japan!! 

Once you enter Japan, you will have to go to a special place in the airport to receive your card. I will be flying to Japan next month, so I will post an update on that experience in Part 3!
