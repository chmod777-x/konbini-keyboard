## First Steps
皆さん：ようこそ。

This is the inagural post of the コンビニキーボード - the Konbini Keyboard.

I am writing this blog to cover a couple of areas:

### Documenting the move to Japan with my family. 
This is a huge undertaking, to say the least. Our kids have mostly grown up in the US, we bought a home here, and got a dog. That's pretty settled if you ask me. However, I'll go over the reasons why we're moving and what has helped us along the way. If you're a technical person or a project manager, this would be akin to a Lessons Learned. 

### Documenting the VISA/Permanent Residence Process
In Japan, I am a foreigner. My wife is Japanese. In order to make this move possible, there are processes to which I had to follow in order to get my permanent residence card. Hopefully these posts will help others who are trying to move with their spouses back to Japan. 

### Japanese Culture Fun
I spent a great deal of my youth growing up in Japan. As a foreigner, it was mesmorizing witnessing Japanese culture and history first hand. Now that I am older (and hopefully a *little* wiser) I hope to find new and interesting cultural aspects about Japan. 

### Hobbies: Tech & Cybersecurity
I am a **geek** - a term I wear proudly. You'll find me posting things about tech, cybersecurity, and other things I find fascinating. 

## Next Steps
Okay - you've made it this far. This is just a rough outline of what this blog is going to be about. It could evolve and change overtime. However, I hope I can provide some good information about Japan and the fun things I find along the way. Thanks for helping me. Now - let's take our first steps.
