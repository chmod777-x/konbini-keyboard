# Hi Konbini Keyboard, I'm Dad


## Who I Am
I am a lot of things: Dad, Husband, Geek.

## What This Blog Is About
This blog serves as a means to document my move to Japan with my family. I will also serve up things I find interesting about Japanese culture/history, technology, and cybersecurity. It will be a little bit of everything.

 ## What is Konbini?!
 Konbini is the Japanese word for Convenience Store. If you've ever been to one of these in Japan, you will understand how clean, efficient and wonderful these stores are. They are truly a one-stop-shop for all your basic needs. The goal of this blog is to be as convenient and helpful as possible - thus, KONBINI KEYBOARD.
